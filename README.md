Small test required by Gfk

## Observations
Preference: readability over "too clever" code.

### Exercises
1. Write a program in any language that prints the numbers from 1 to 100.    But for multiples of three print “Bizz”” instead of the number and for the multiples of five print ““Appz Appz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print ““BizzAppz”.

		$ node ./first_exercise/first_exercise.js`

2. Write a class (prototype) in JavaScript, with at least one method, and another class which extends the previous class. Make sure that when an instance is created of the latter, it returns true for an instanceof-check check for both prototypes and that the method on the first prototype can be invoked.

		$ node second_exercise/second_exercise.js

3. Using the attached data, create a chart in JavaScript which shows a trend over time of the percentage of responses for that day which have a value of “yes” for the “answer” column.

	- Open browser an go to `<route_to>/third_exercise/third_exercise.html`.
	- Press **Choose File** and select the file `data.csv`.
	- GoogleCharts was chosen for no particular reason.

4. Use the two url's shown below to retrieve the strings they return and after they both complete, concatenate both strings in the correct order with a space in between and display the result.
